## Combinatorial Games
Combinatorial Games are two-person games with [perfect information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information) and no chance moves/randomization. The outcome of these games is determined by set of states, initial state and which player's turn to move.

## Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT)
Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT) is study of [sequential games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_game) with perfect information. In CGT, we deal with two types of games.
  - [Partisan Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_game)
      - Possible moves from any position of game are different for different players. i.e. From some possible positions, some moves are restricted for some players.
      - e.g. [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)
      - Sprague-Grundy Theorem fails for partisan games.
  - [Impartial Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartial_game)
      - All the possible moves from any position of game are same for all the players.
      - e.g. [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim), [Sprouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouts_(game)), [Cram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram_(game)) etc.
